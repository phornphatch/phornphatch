<h3>Full-Stack Software Developer 🚀  </h3>
<h5>work romotely from the happiest country in the world, Helsinki, Finland</h5>
<br>
✨  I dream of shopping and traveling full-time - unless I'm a materials 
<br>engineer turned a coder who is continuously upgrading the coding skill.
<br><br>And now it's been 3 years in this role! 
<br>My main languages are Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
<br>Even though I can work as a full stack developer, my passion lies in frontend development.
<br><br>I also love working with UI/UX design. All my personal projects, I design them myself.

<br> <br>
I spend all my free time in bed. Not actually sleeping but just laying there for eating, coding, blogging, video editing and watching TV series and movies on Netflix. I also enjoy going for a walk and traveling to new places.
